### Project Idea:
The project idea is to build a real-time face recognition system that can detect and identify individuals in a video stream. The system will use a combination of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize faces and match them against a database of known faces using flask framework.
### Key Features:
1. Real-time Face Detection: The system will detect faces in a video stream and extract facial features.
2. Face Recognition: The system will compare the extracted facial features against a database of known faces to identify matches.
3. Real-time Video Stream: The system will display the video stream in real-time, with bounding boxes and labels around detected faces.
4. Web-based Interface: The system will have a web-based interface that allows users to view the video stream and can be improved to send notifications when a known face is detected.
### Technical Requirements:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
3. Face Recognition Library: Face Recognition
4. Web Framework: Flask
### Usage:
The project combines computer vision, machine learning, and web development to create a real-time face recognition system with a wide range of applications.
### Steps:
#### Step 1: Set up the Project Environment:
1. Install Python 3.xx and pip (if not already installed).
2. Create a new virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install required packages: Flask, OpenCV, Face Recognition, and NumPy.
4. Set up the project directory structure using flaskframework.
#### Step 2: Collect and Prepare Known Faces:
1. Collect images of known faces (e.g., people you want to recognize).
2. Create a directory to store the known face images.
#### Step 3: Write the Face Recognition Code:
1. Import required libraries: OpenCV, Face Recognition, and NumPy.
2. Load the known face images and create a list of face encodings.
3. Define a function to detect and recognize faces in a video stream.
4. Use the Face Recognition library to compare face encodings and identify matches.
#### Step 4: Create the Flask Web App:
1. Create a new Flask app.
2. Define a route for the video stream.
3. Use the (generate_frames) function to generate video frames.
4. Send the video frames to the client as a JPEG image.
#### Step 5: Create the HTML Template:
Create an index.html file in the templates directory and add an <img> tag to display the video stream and use the url_for function to link to the video stream route.
#### Step 6: Run the Project:
Run the Flask app and open a web browser and navigate to the project URL.

### First we need to make sure that we have a life stream using flask and simple video frame generating function:
